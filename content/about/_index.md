## Hello and welcome to my site  

Hey there, I'm Tuyen – your friendly neighborhood Software Engineer and, I admit, a part-time slacker. Picture this: I arrived in Japan right in the midst of the COVID-19 storm, armed with nothing but my love for super sentai and Japanese anime. Guess what? I not only survived but thrived, all thanks to those masked heroes and epic animated adventures! 🦸‍♂️🌟  

My journey? Oh, it's been a rollercoaster. I've interned at Google Japan, dabbled in tech at Tokyo Techies, and learned the ropes as a part-timer at FPT Japan. From Frontend finesse to Backend brilliance, I'm your go-to tech guru.

So, who am I, you ask? I'm the ultimate trifecta: a gymming enthusiast, an insatiably curious reader, and a developer with big dreams. Challenges? I devour them for breakfast. Whether I'm setting personal records at the gym, experimenting (and occasionally burning) things in the kitchen, or conquering virtual realms, I set targets and chase them down, all with a grin on my face. 😄

In a world where coding meets chaos and cosplay, I'm the hero of my own story – armed with passion, persistence, and a healthy dose of pixelated fun! 🎮✨
